# Gate-0 — ID 0.9
## Gate-0 Freeze Declaration

### Declaration
This document formally declares **Gate-0** of the PACE ERP system as
**COMPLETE, VERIFIED, and FROZEN**.

From this point forward:
- No Gate-0 rules, contracts, or invariants may be modified.
- Any change impacting Gate-0 scope requires a new Gate revision
  (e.g., Gate-0.1 or Gate-1 override) with explicit governance approval.

### Scope Covered
Gate-0 freeze includes (but is not limited to):

#### Frontend Discipline
- 0.2C — Frontend environment discipline
- 0.2D — Frontend deploy neutrality
- 0.2E — Domain-bound frontend rule

#### Backend & Data Foundations
- Postgres schema namespace definition
- Global RLS enablement
- Default-deny RLS policies
- Service role usage policy
- Health endpoint contract
- Structured logging contract

#### Governance & Standards
- File ID tagging standard
- Single-source-of-truth (SSOT) confirmation
- Emulator vs production parity principles

### Verification Basis
This freeze is declared based on:
- Successful implementation on `dev` branch
- Complete documentation under `/docs/gate-0/`
- Static audits confirming rule compliance
- No pending Gate-0 blockers or open violations

### Effective Date
The freeze takes effect immediately upon merge of the
Gate-0 promotion PR into `main`.

### Consequences
- Gate-0 is now immutable.
- All subsequent work must reference Gate-0 as a fixed foundation.
- Any deviation is considered a governance violation.
