# Gate-0 — ID 0.2C  
## Frontend Environment Discipline

### Status
- **DONE**
- **FROZEN**

### Purpose
Ensure the frontend:
- Never hardcodes backend URLs
- Uses environment variables as the single source of backend origin
- Remains portable across Vercel, Emulator, Electron, and Mobile

### Core Rules
1. Backend origin must be read only from environment variables.
2. Frontend must not contain any hardcoded backend URLs.
3. Environment access must be centralized in one file.
4. All API calls must flow through a single API client.

### Implementation
- Environment access: `src/config/env.js`
- API client: `src/api/apiClient.js`

```js
export const ENV = {
  API_BASE: import.meta.env.VITE_API_BASE,
};

if (!ENV.API_BASE) {
  throw new Error('VITE_API_BASE is not defined');
}
API Contract
Frontend uses relative paths only (/api/...)

Backend origin is prepended centrally

Cookies are sent via credentials: 'include'

Emulator Support
Emulator switching is achieved via .env.local

No code or script changes are required

Audit Proof
Recursive scan confirms no hardcoded backend URLs

import.meta.env usage is restricted to env.js only

Invariant
Frontend behavior must never change across environments.
Only runtime configuration may differ.
